# Test Workflow for Carrier Helper
#
# This workflow runs unit tests with code coverage on pull requests.
# It is optional and only runs when tests are present.
#
# Triggers:
# - Pull requests to main branch (manual trigger available)
# - Can be manually triggered via workflow_dispatch
#
# To enable automatic PR testing, change 'workflow_dispatch' to include 'pull_request'
