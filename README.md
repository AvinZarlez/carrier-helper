## What It Does

- **One-click time tracking** — press "Clock In" when your shift starts and "Clock Out" when it ends.
- **Local storage** — all entries are saved directly in your browser; no server or login needed.
- **Spreadsheet view** — every clock-in and clock-out entry is displayed in a sortable table so you can review your hours at a glance.
